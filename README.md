Prediction Canoe Performance (Team Squat)

Monitoring of anthropometry, physical fitness, and sport-specific performance in
young athletes is a crucial part in talent identification and development in
sports.

The aim of this study was to determine a predictive model of
anthropometric, physical fitness, and sport-specific performance
data in young canoe sprint athletes for adult performance level. In
a prospective study design, anthropometric, physical fitness and
sport-specific performance data of 731 young canoe sprint athletes (12
to 16 years) obtained between 1992 and 2019 were used for predictive
modelling. Tests for anthropometry comprised body height, body mass,
arm span, and leg length. In terms of physical fitness, tests for
cardiorespiratory endurance (800-m/1.500-m run), muscular endurance
(bench press, bench pull), linear speed (30-m sprint), and muscle
power (3 kg-medicine-ball-throw test) were included. Sport-specific
tests included 250-m and 2.000-m on-water canoe sprint performance.
Additionally, three categorial variables (discipline [canoe men, kayak
women, kayak men], age, and performance level [elite, sub-elite]) were
used to classify the athletes. The performance level was defined as
dependend variable and described the highest performance level the
athletes achieved during their sporting career.
